# GenomeRecoding

Users input a segments of a virus genome. This application will identify current locations of all CpGs (Cs followed by Gs), all locations that can become a CpG (by mutating the nucleotide sequence such that it encodes for the same exact amino acid sequence), and will output a DNA sequence that will encode the same amino acid as the user input. This outputted sequence will optimize the CpGs spacing (13 nucleotides away from each other) such that the virus will be weakened.
